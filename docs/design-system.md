# Custom Design System (based on Lunit)

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

Lunit (루닛) is the design language of a **medical AI company that wants to be read like a journal article, not sold like a SaaS**. Where most healthcare-AI marketing leans into either soft-pastel reassurance or bold-pharma authority, Lunit refuses both. The home page opens on pure white anchored by warm-cool gunmetal ink `#232f32` for body and a darker `#151515` for the hero — never pure `#000` for the standing copy. The single saturated accent is a deep electric blue, captured at `#1032cf` and brightening to `#2a4eef`; it appears in cookie consents, system affordances, and the occasional brand band, but is deliberately *withheld* from the primary CTA. The primary CTA is instead a black pill — `#000000` background, `#ffffff` label, `border-radius: 100px`. That black pill is the only rounded thing on the site. Everything else — sections, cards, images, navigation, logo wall, footer — has `border-radius: 0`. This binary radius logic (square surfaces, pill action) is Lunit's geometric thesis.

The typography is the other thesis. Headings are set in **ClashGrotesk** at light weight (400), body text in **Lexend** at weight 300. Both are intentional anti-tropes. ClashGrotesk avoids the "Inter / Söhne / Helvetica Now" tech-startup stamp; Lexend is a typeface engineered specifically to reduce reading fatigue and improve reading proficiency, and choosing it for clinical and oncology copy is itself a statement about audience care. The hero H1 sits at **78px / 84px line-height** in ClashGrotesk 400 — large but not heavy. Pharma marketing typically defaults to semibold or bold weights because legal-grade confidence reads as visual heft; Lunit goes light, which reads as **scientific composure**. Stats land in the same restrained register: `10,000+ Customer Sites · 65+ Countries · 700+ Publications` are placed as quiet typographic facts, not infographic explosions.

Atmosphere is built through **vertical band switching**, not elevation. There are essentially zero drop shadows on the surveyed surfaces. Depth comes from sections claiming full-bleed width and alternating their backgrounds — white → black band → off-white footer (`#eff0f4`) — so the page reads as a sequence of editorial spreads rather than a stack of UI cards. Motion is restrained to AOS scroll-reveal fades; there is no parallax, no autoplay video header, no animated counter. The audience is radiologists, oncology researchers, regulators, and institutional investors — the design choices everywhere read as *we know who is looking*.

**Key Characteristics:**
- ClashGrotesk + Lexend font pairing — display grotesk + reading-optimized text face, both LIGHT weights as the rule
- Hero H1 at 78px / 400 weight, body at 18-20px / 300 weight — authority through size and air, not heft
- Single accent: deep electric blue `#1032cf` (bright sibling `#2a4eef`) — used only for system, cookie, and dark-band moments
- Primary marketing CTA is **black pill**, not blue — blue is withheld
- Binary radius rule: `0px` everywhere except the pill CTA at `100px`
- Warm-cool gunmetal ink `#232f32` for body, near-black `#151515` for heroes — never pure `#000` in standing copy
- Off-white footer `#eff0f4` — the only branded surface tint
- Full-bleed band-switching layout — sections alternate white / black / off-white, no card-on-canvas
- Zero shadows / zero card elevation — depth is band-switching, not floating
- Uppercase 13.2px Lexend nav — institutional small-caps register, not friendly-app

## 2. Color Palette & Roles

### Primary
- `#151515` — **Hero ink**. Used for H1 only.
- `#232f32` — **Body ink**. Warm-cool gunmetal. Default text color across body, nav, footer.
- `#1032cf` — **Signature blue**. Cookie "Allow all", blue band moments, system-affordance contexts.
- `#2a4eef` — **Bright blue**. Hover / link / focus sibling of `#1032cf`.

### Surfaces
- `#ffffff` — Page canvas default.
- `#000000` — Dark band / primary CTA fill / occasional inverted hero block.
- `#eff0f4` — Footer surface. The only branded off-white in the system.

### Inverse
- `#ffffff` — Label on dark CTAs / dark bands.

### Semantic notes
- **No green for "success", no red for "danger" observed in marketing surfaces.** Lunit's marketing site does not show product UI affordances; semantic colors live inside the clinical products (INSIGHT CXR / DBT / MMG), not on the brand site.
- **Blue is system, not brand-action.** The brand-action color is black. This is unusual — most B2B health-AI sites use their accent for primary CTAs.

## 3. Typography

### Stack
```
display: "ClashGrotesk", system-ui, sans-serif
text:    "Lexend", system-ui, sans-serif
fallback: Arial, sans-serif
```

### Scale (sampled live)
- **Hero H1** — ClashGrotesk · 78px / 84px · weight 400
- **Section H2** — ClashGrotesk · ~48–56px · weight 400
- **Body lg** — Lexend · 20px / 28px · weight 300
- **Body** — Lexend · 18.4px · weight 300
- **Body sm** — Lexend · 15px · weight 400
- **Nav** — Lexend · 13.2px · weight 400 · uppercase

### Rules
- LIGHT-weight defaults across all heading levels. Bold weights are not part of the brand voice.
- Body text is Lexend 300 — verify against your runtime if you cannot license Lexend; substitute with Inter 300 at the same metrics if blocked.
- Nav is uppercase 13.2px with letter tracking — small-cap institutional register.
- Display copy never wraps mid-noun-phrase in the hero. The H1 break is editorial.

## 4. Radius & Geometry

This section is the brand thesis.

- **Default radius: `0px`.** Every section, image, card, logo tile, input, footer column, and surface that is not a primary action is square-cornered.
- **Pill radius: `100px`.** Exactly one element rounds: the primary marketing CTA (`Contact Us`). The pill is reserved for the single most human-facing action on the page.
- **Secondary chip / checkbox:** 3.75px (third-party cookie banner).
- **No mid-range radii.** No 4px, 6px, 8px, 12px, 16px curves anywhere.

This binary logic is what separates Lunit from peers that use a uniform 8/12px round-everything system.

## 5. Elevation & Depth

- **No shadows.** Across all surveyed sections, `box-shadow` is `none`.
- Depth is achieved by **full-bleed band switching**:
  - Section A: white canvas, dark ink
  - Section B: black canvas, white ink
  - Section C: off-white `#eff0f4`, dark ink
- Cards do not float. Logos do not float. The page is read as a sequence of editorial pages, not as a stack of objects.

## 6. Spacing & Rhythm

- Sections are **full viewport width**, edge-to-edge — no max-width "page frame" wrapping the whole document.
- Vertical rhythm is generous. Headings have substantial top/bottom air; copy blocks are narrow-column to maintain comfortable measure.
- CTA pill padding ≈ `14px 28px`.
- Nav item padding ≈ `8–20px` depending on top-row vs main-row.

## 7. Motion

- Library observed: **AOS** (Animate-On-Scroll) — `aos-init aos-animate` classes throughout.
- Effect set: scroll-triggered fade / fade-up, low amplitude, short duration.
- **No parallax.** **No autoplay hero video.** **No counter animations on the stats band.**
- This restraint is itself a positioning signal: motion is a luxury the audience does not need.

## 8. Imagery & Iconography

- **Hero treatment**: Lunit uses dimensional product / scan imagery (chest X-ray fragments, mammography overlays) rendered in a *desaturated, blue-graded* register. The brand's signature blue is allowed to pool inside imagery in a way it is denied to the CTA.
- **Logo wall**: monochrome grayscale, no background tile, tight kerning.
- **Icons**: outline-style, single-stroke, no fill. Aligned to the same flat / square geometric thesis.
- **No stock people imagery, no AI-generated abstract gradients, no hex-mesh "tech" decoration.** The page refuses every B2B-AI cliché.

## 9. Components

### Primary CTA — Pill
- `background: #000000`
- `color: #ffffff`
- `font: Lexend 16.4px / weight ~400`
- `border-Radius: 100px`
- `padding: ~14px 28px`
- `border: none`
- `text-transform: none`

### Secondary nav (top-row)
- Plain text link, no background, no border
- `color: #000000` or `#232f32` depending on context
- `font: Lexend 13.2px / 400 / uppercase`

### Section heading block
- ClashGrotesk · 48–78px · weight 400
- Color: `#151515` (hero) or `#232f32` (interior sections)
- Optional eyebrow above: Lexend 13–15px uppercase

### Stat block (e.g. `10,000+`)
- ClashGrotesk · large display size
- Color: `#232f32`
- Label below in Lexend 15–18px weight 300

### Card (news / solutions)
- `border-Radius: 100px`
- No shadow
- Thumbnail at 16:9 or 4:3 above, ClashGrotesk title below, Lexend kicker
- Hover: subtle ink shift; no lift, no scale

### Footer
- `background: #eff0f4`
- `color: #232f32`
- Column-grid of product / company / legal nav
- No social-icon row dominance — institutional, not consumer

## 10. Voice

The Lunit voice in your generated work should:
- **State the science**, then state the consequence. Lead with what the AI does, follow with what changes for the patient or clinician.
- **Use light typographic weight to carry authority** — do not reach for bold to add confidence.
- **Avoid emotive verbs** ("battle", "fight", "transform lives") in standing copy. Use precise verbs ("detect", "stratify", "screen", "support").
- **Refuse exclamation marks. Refuse all-caps shouting (except the institutional nav register).**
- **Numbers are stated dryly.** "10,000+ Customer Sites" — no exclaim, no "amazing", no decoration.

**Do not copy Lunit's specific marketing taglines, product names, or proprietary clinical claims into derivative work.** Use the structural voice rules above; write fresh copy. Brand assets in this directory are for reference inspection only.

## 11. Layout Patterns

- **Hero band**: full-bleed white. H1 left-aligned (typically), sub-deck below, single pill CTA. No imagery on top of the heading — imagery, if present, sits below the H1 or in a parallel column.
- **Stats band**: 3 columns, large display numerals, single-line labels. Generous air.
- **Solutions overview**: editorial card grid, 2-up or 3-up, each card a square-cornered thumbnail + title + 1–2 lines of kicker.
- **Partnering / testimonial band**: full-bleed logo wall in monochrome, or a quote in ClashGrotesk display size with attribution in Lexend small.
- **Footer**: off-white `#eff0f4`, multi-column column-nav, no social-feed widgets, no newsletter signup dominance.

## 12. What This System Refuses

The negative space is as informative as the positive choices. The Lunit system explicitly does not use:
- Rounded cards (12 / 16 / 20px) of any kind
- Drop shadows or elevation
- Saturated blue on primary CTAs (the brand color is *withheld* from action)
- Bold typographic weights for confidence
- Hero video autoplay
- Stock photography of "diverse smiling teams"
- Hex-mesh / circuit-board / neural-net visual cliché
- Multi-accent palettes (green + blue + orange "tech" mixes)
- Exclamation marks or emotive marketing verbs

When you generate work in the Lunit register, treat this refusal list as a hard filter.

## 13. When to Reach for This System

Choose Lunit-style when the brief is:
- A medical / clinical / regulated-industry product targeting expert audiences (clinicians, researchers, regulators, institutional buyers)
- A research-grade B2B product where credibility must read as **scientific composure**, not sales energy
- A category whose competitors lean either soft-pastel-reassuring or bold-pharma — and you want to position above both
- A product where the user is reading carefully and slowly, not scrolling fast

Avoid Lunit-style when the brief is consumer fintech, lifestyle commerce, social, or anywhere the audience expects warm-friendly app idioms.

## 14. Token Reference

See `assets/_reference/tokens.json`, `fonts.json`, `structure.json` for machine-readable token sets sampled live on 2026-05-14 from `https://www.lunit.io/`.

See `assets/_reference/.live-inspect-proof.json` for the raw CDP `getComputedStyle` samples (≥5 per requirement; 8 captured).

## 15. Verification & Sources

**Verified:** 2026-05-14

### Tier 1 — Live inspect (REQUIRED · COMPLETED)
- **Method:** Chrome DevTools Protocol :9222, `Runtime.evaluate` + `getComputedStyle` on production DOM
- **Surface:** `https://www.lunit.io/` (English root)
- **Captured:** hero H1, 7 major `<section>` elements, stats band, 5 CTA candidates, 4 nav links, 3 body paragraphs, footer, html/body roots, plus 23 targeted samples — **8 samples retained as `.live-inspect-proof.json` raw_samples** (requirement: ≥5)
- **Confidence:** HIGH for color, type, radius, elevation. MEDIUM for spacing (only viewport-relative measured).

### Tier 1 — Official Design System lookup (REQUIRED · NEGATIVE RESULT documented)
- **Attempted:** `design.lunit.io` → DNS fails (HTTP 000, no such subdomain)
- **Attempted:** Lunit GitHub org `github.com/lunit-io` → 10 public repos enumerated (`archon`, `benchmark-ssl-pathology`, `CoEval`, `dicom-rs`, `lumberjack`, `mmg-model-nia`, `nlst-nodule-detection`, `ocelot23algo`, `openslide`, `spec-cxr`) — all medical-imaging / ML research code, **no design-system / tokens / component-library / Storybook repo**
- **Attempted:** keyword scan of `www.lunit.io` HTML for `design-system / design-tokens / brand-guidelines / lunit-ui / storybook` → no hits (the only match was a generic "Figma" string in cookie-vendor copy)
- **Conclusion:** Lunit does not publish an open design system, Storybook, or brand-guidelines site as of 2026-05-14. This is consistent with their positioning (clinical / regulated / B2B medical AI — they have no incentive to ship a public DS).

### Tier 2 — 3rd-party DS directories
- `getdesign.md/lunit` — not present
- `styles.refero.design/?q=lunit` — not present
- **Both empty.** Consistent with Tier-2 directory bias against Korean and against B2B-clinical brands.

### Tier 3 — Brand-published narrative / blog
- `www.lunit.io/en/about/`, `www.lunit.io/en/careers/` — corporate narrative pages, no DS content
- No public Lunit tech-blog or Medium account observed
- Investor-relations pages exist (`investors.lunit.io` referenced indirectly) but contain no design content

### Tier 4 — Stack fingerprint (observed)
- **CMS:** WordPress + Oxygen Builder (`oxy-*` and `ct-*` class prefixes confirm)
- **Scroll motion:** AOS (`aos-init aos-animate`)
- **Fonts:** Lexend (likely Google Fonts), ClashGrotesk (likely Fontshare / Indian Type Foundry)
- **Analytics:** Google, HubSpot, Microsoft (per cookie-consent disclosure)
- **CSS custom properties:** only WordPress defaults (`--wp-*`, `--wp--preset--*`) — no Lunit-namespaced custom properties exported globally, which corroborates the "no public DS" finding

### Tier 5 — IP & licensing notes
- All brand assets in `assets/_reference/` are **for reference inspection only**.
- **No verbatim taglines** from `www.lunit.io` are reproduced in this DESIGN.md. The voice rules in §10 paraphrase structural patterns only.
- Section names in `structure.json` are quoted because they describe page anatomy, not brand copy; generated work must produce its own headings.
- Lexend is OFL-licensed (free for commercial). ClashGrotesk is free via Fontshare for commercial use under their license — verify license terms before shipping derivative work.

### Conflicts unresolved
- None. All Tier 1 measurements are internally consistent (single source = live DOM on 2026-05-14).

## Iconography & SVG Guidelines

### Icon Library

Use a single, consistent icon library throughout the project. Recommended options:

- **Lucide React** (`lucide-react`): Default for shadcn/ui projects. 1,400+ icons, tree-shakeable, consistent 24x24 grid.
- **Radix Icons** (`@radix-ui/react-icons`): 300+ icons, 15x15 grid, minimal and geometric.
- **Heroicons** (`@heroicons/react`): 300+ icons by Tailwind team, outline and solid variants.

Pick ONE library and use it everywhere. Do not mix icon libraries within the same project.

### SVG Usage Rules

- All icons must be inline SVG components (not `<img>` tags) for color and size control.
- Icon size follows the type scale: 16px (inline), 20px (buttons), 24px (standalone).
- Icon color inherits from `currentColor` -- never hard-code fill/stroke colors.
- For custom/brand icons, export as SVG components with `currentColor` fills.
- Stroke width: 1.5px-2px for outline icons. Keep consistent across the project.

### Icon Sizing Scale

| Context | Size | Usage |
|---------|------|-------|
| Inline text | 16px (1rem) | Badges, labels, breadcrumbs |
| Button icon | 18px (1.125rem) | Icon buttons, CTA icons |
| Standalone | 24px (1.5rem) | Navigation, card icons |
| Feature | 32-48px | Hero sections, empty states |

### SVG Optimization

- Run all custom SVGs through SVGO before committing.
- Remove unnecessary attributes: `xmlns`, `xml:space`, editor metadata.
- Use `viewBox` instead of fixed `width`/`height` for scalability.

## Document Policies

### No Emojis

This design system must not use emojis in any UI element, component, label, status indicator, or documentation.
Use SVG icons from the chosen icon library instead. Emojis render inconsistently across platforms and break visual coherence.

- Status indicators: use colored dots or icon components, not emoji.
- Section markers: use text prefixes ("DO:" / "DON'T:") or icons, not checkmark/cross emojis.
- Navigation: use icon components, not emoji.

### Format Compliance
